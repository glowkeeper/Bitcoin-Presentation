## What is Bitcoin?

_"Bitcoin is a **consensus network** that enables a new payment system and a completely **digital money**. It is the first decentralised **peer-to-peer payment network** that is powered by its users with **no central authority** or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like **cash for the internet**. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent **triple entry bookkeeping system** in existence."_

_Bitcoin Website FAQ_

## How does Bitcoin work?

> + Paying with bitcoin means creating a record of the transaction in the **blockchain**
> + The blockchain is a distributed, historical record of all Bitcoin transactions, recorded in **blocks**
> + **Miners** on the network use their computing power to verify the transactions, grouping them into blocks
> + Using the block transaction data as inputs, miners race to solve a computationally intensive cryptographic puzzle in order to win **new bitcoins**, hence Bitcoin is referrred to as a **cryptocurrency**
> + Difficulty of the puzzle is automatically adjusted so that a new block is mined every **10mins**

<div class="notes">
Miners get 25 Bitcoins when they mine a block.
</div>
 
## How Is Bitcoin Different From the £?

> + Digital only - No physical currency
> + No central bank (no governmental control)
> + No individual unit with identifiers (e.g. serial numbers)
> + Automated control of money supply (capped to 21 million bitcoins)
> + Trust-free system (no third parties required)
> + Transactions are anonymous (but may be traceable)

<div class="notes">
Fiat currency is state backed currency, such as the $ or £.
</div> 
 
## Bitcoin Software

+ Wallets / Clients (open source)
	+ Connect to the network to process transactions
	+ Manage bitcoins
	+ Protect encryption key
+ Mining software (open source)
	+ Generate new bitcoins
	+ Process the blockchain

## History of Bitcoin

> + Bitcoin began as a [2008 white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf "Bitcoin White Paper")
> + On 3rd January 2009, block 0, the genesis block of Bitcoin, was mined
> + The first transaction of Bitcoin, in block 170, took place On 12th January 2009
> + On 6th February 2010, the first Bitcoin currency exchange was established
> + On 22nd May 2010, the first real-world transaction took place when the Jacksonville programer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for a pizza

## History of Bitcoin <br>(continued)

> + The notorious online Bitcoin marketplace, Silk Road, known as the ‘eBay for drugs’, opened its doors for business in early 2011. The FBI finally shut the service down in October 2013
> + On 6th December 2012, Bitcoin Central becomes the first Bitcoin exchange to be licensed as a European bank
> + On 2nd May 2013, the world’s first Bitcoin ATM is unveiled in San Diego, California
> + In September 2014, the U.S.Commodity Futures Trading Commission become the first U.S. regulatory agency to approve a Bitcoin financial product
> + On 17th December 2015, The Linux Foundation announced a collaborative effort to “develop an enterprise grade, open source distributed ledger framework.” There are thirty founding corporates collaborating on the project, including companies such as The London Stock Exchange Group, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Cisco, Deutsch Börse, and ANZ Bank


# Evaluative Framework

- - -

## Framework Overview

Here we define ‘success’ of bitcoin as an open source project:

+ Open vs Closed
+ Perspectives
+ Focus of evaluation
+ Unique features of Bitcoin
+ Bitcoin 'success' / objectives
+ Our framework
 
## Evaluating Open vs Closed Source Software

Open-source has some key differences from closed source software that affect its evaluation:

> + No cost effectiveness / profit margin
> + No clearly defined targets 
> + No ‘final version’
 
## Evaluation Perspectives

+ User (demand side)
	+ Individual
	+ Business
	+ Society

+ Developer (supply side)
+ Two identities merge in open source: Developers = Users
 
## Focus of Evaluation

+ Product
	+ Code quality
	+ Functionality
	+ User satisfaction
	+ Impact
+ Process
	+ Online ‘community’ / ecosystem
	+ Effectiveness / Efficiency of development (rate of bug fixes etc.)
	+ Degree of concentration (lines of code / developer)
 
## Unique Factors When Evaluating Bitcoin

Not a _product_, per se, but new solution for online transactions:

> + First ‘cryptocurrency’ (No preexisting rivals to benchmark)
> + Can evaluate using financial metrics (exchange rate, volatility, transaction volume etc.)
> + Not a software tool so user feedback shallow, user take up a better measure

## What does 'success' of Bitcoin mean (objectives)?

> + 'Proof on concept' of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology
> + Value transfer mechanism existing alongside fiat currency
> + A decentralised currency to replace fiat money 

## Our Framework

Focusing on **take-up** of the currency and the **process** of development. We will analyse bitcoin by looking at:

+ Supply side (development)
	+ Github rankings
	+ Developer concentration
	+ Forks

+ Demand side (take up)
	+ Users over time
	+ Financial metrics (value, volatility, transaction volume)	
	+ Other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies (impact)

# Bitcoin Development

## Bitcoin's Community of Practice

Bitcoin has defined the process of _Community of Practice_, via the Bitcoin Improvement Process (BIP):

![](images/BIP_Workflow.png)

_Source: Bitcoin Wiki_

## GitHub's Community of Practice

GitHub too has processes that define its _Community of Practice_:

1. Fork the GitHub repository and clone it to local machine
3. Check out master branch
4. Create topic branch
5. Write patches
6. Stage and Commit patches
7. Push the new branch back up to the GitHub fork
8. Send a Pull Request

## Bitcoin's Organisation of Practice

Bitcoin has a group of core developers. Contributions are based on the Open Source model of meritocracy. 

Development of Bitcoin Core is relatively concentrated, with 7 developers contributing 69% of the code

## GitHub History

Bitcoin has evolved a highly active developer community with many forks
[Bitcoin GitHub History Visualised](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTILX-_JzTs "Bitcoin GitHub History Visualised")

## GitHub Statistics

Following is a list of key GitHub statistics:

+ Forks
+ Stars
+ Users

## Github Forks

The Bitcoin project is second on page 6, so with ten results per page, Bitcoin is ranked 52nd by _Github Forks_ 
 
![](images/BitcoinRankingByForks.png)

Those forks have spawned many _altcoins_, or alternatives to Bitcoin, with 669 other cryptocurrencies active as of August 2015. _Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies_

One important fork is Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Classic - rival directions for the blockchain

## Github Stars

Users show appreciation of a project through _GitHub Stars_. The Bitcoin project is at the bottom of page 28. With ten results per page, that means that Bitcoin was ranked 280th by 'GitHub Stars' (there are just over 3 million public repositories on GitHub with at least one star).

![](images/BitcoinRankingByStars.png)

## GitHub Users

At the time of writing, GitHub had 1,730,452 users with at least 1 follower. The Bitcoin user is the 184th most starred.

## Overview of <br>Bitcoin Take-up 

We will look at the take-up of Bitcoin from the following perspectives:

+ Users
+ Financial Metrics

## Number of Users

User base has grown rapidly, now totalling around 7 million wallets (rough proxy of users).

This number is high for a cryptocurrency (No.1) and for an open source project, but low as a payment service.
Paypal had 179 million active users as of 2015 (Statista.com)

## Daily Transactions

Bitcoin's total unique transactions is currently around 200,000 per day, valued at around $126 million. 

Current blockchain has a cap of 7 transactions per second (tsp).

Visa processes, on average, 2000 tps.

## Forex Transactions

The top 5 countries for daily transaction volume in 2013:

| Country | Amount (US$ billion) | %share |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| United Kingdom | 2,726 | 40.9 | 
| United States  | 1,263 | 18.9 |  
| Singapore      | 383   | 5.7  | 
| Japan          | 374   | 5.6  | 
| Hong Kong      | 275   | 4.1  |

## Conclusions

> + By GitHub and financial metrics, Bitcoin is a highly successful open source project with a vibrant and active user and developer community
> + Bitcoin has succeeded as a proof of concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology and created a new technological paradigm
> + For now it functions as a niche transaction alternative to fiat currency, but its long term prospects are doubtful given take up barriers and technological constraints such as transaction speed, blockchain size and energy use
> + Bitcoin is still a very small market compared to fiat currency, take up may reach a natural saturation of tech-savvy and libertarian users and remain limited where there is a functioning state-backed financial system
> + Bitcoin's long-term success will likely be the blockchain's contribution to future distributed, trust-fee transaction systems

## The Economic Layer for the Internet

_"At the very least, blockchain technology could provide an economic layer for the Internet, allowing for seamless asset transfer and contract exchange on a much larger scale than has hitherto been possible."_

_Swan: Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy_

## Unexpected Uses

_"Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected."_
